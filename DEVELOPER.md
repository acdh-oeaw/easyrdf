# Contributing

Contributions to the EasyRdf codebase are welcome using the usual Github pull request workflow.

You can run the PHP unit test suite with:

```
make test
```

Unit tests are automatically run after being received by Github (library and examples):

## Notes

* Please create an [issue](https://github.com/sweetyrdf/easyrdf/issues) before starting work on any significant changes
* We only accept code, which comes with tests, no matter if its a new feature or bug fix.
