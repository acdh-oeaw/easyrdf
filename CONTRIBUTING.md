# Contributing

Contributions to the codebase and documentation are welcome using the usual Github pull request workflow.

Unit tests are automatically run after code is being received by Github (library and examples):

https://travis-ci.com/github/sweetyrdf/easyrdf

### Pull requests for sweetyrdf/easyrdf

Make sure you send the pull request to `sweetyrdf/easyrdf`. To do that, manually select it in the drop down menu of the "Open a pull request"-UI.

## Important notes

* Please create an [issue](https://github.com/sweetyrdf/easyrdf/issues) before starting work on any significant changes
* We only accept code, which comes with tests, no matter if its a new feature or bug fix. It strengthened the codebase and avoids regressions later on.
