EasyRdf
=======

This is an ACDH-CH fork of the [EasyRdf](https://github.com/easyrdf/easyrdf) library fixing some inconsitencies in its behavior and adding few features we needed.

Since spring 2024 it is considered obsolete. We have switched to the [rdfInterface](https://github.com/sweetrdf/rdfInterface/) libraries ecosystem.

By the way the original EasyRdf library is not maintained since 2021. If you want to use it, the [sweetrdf/EasyRdf](https://github.com/sweetrdf/easyrdf) fork provides an actively maintained version.
